# Conda (Stage-2 Wrappers)

The scripts under `stage-2/system/conda/` are a mix of:

- **Wrappers** that forward to stage-1 canonical scripts (preferred), and
- **Stage-2-only** utilities that are inherently tied to stage-2 storage behavior.

Canonical docs (preferred): `stage-1/system/conda/README.md`
