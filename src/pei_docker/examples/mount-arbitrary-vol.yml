# GPU-enabled development container with persistent storage optimization
# This example creates a heavy-duty C++ development environment with GPU support
# Uses volume mounting to preserve data and speed up package installation

stage_1:
  # Base image configuration - using NVIDIA CUDA runtime
  image:
    base: nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-runtime-ubuntu22.04  # CUDA 12.3.2 runtime on Ubuntu 22.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1                      # Name of the generated stage-1 image

  # SSH server configuration
  ssh:
    port: 22                       # SSH port inside the container
    host_port: 2222                # Port on host machine mapped to container SSH port

    # Define SSH users with their passwords
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'          # Regular user for development
      root:                        # Root user configuration
        password: root              # Root password
        pubkey_file: null           # No SSH key file (use password auth)

  # GPU support configuration
  device:
    type: gpu                      # Enable GPU support (requires NVIDIA Docker runtime)

  # Package repository configuration for faster downloads
  apt:
    repo_source: 'tuna'            # Use Tsinghua University mirror (good for China/Asia)

  # Volume mounts for stage-1 (system-level optimizations)
  mount:
    # Persist APT cache to speed up future package installations
    apt_cache:
      type: auto-volume            # Use automatically managed Docker volume
      dst_path: /var/cache/apt     # APT cache directory in container

# Stage 2: Development environment with persistent user data
stage_2:
  # Image configuration
  image:
    output: pei-image:stage-2      # Name of the final stage-2 image
  
  # GPU support (inherited from stage-1)
  device:
    type: gpu                      # Maintain GPU support in final image

  # Volume mounts for stage-2 (user-level persistence)
  mount:
    # Preserve user home directory to maintain development settings and files
    home_me:
      type: auto-volume            # Use automatically managed Docker volume
      dst_path: /home/me           # User home directory in container

    # Re-mount APT cache (mount settings don't inherit from stage-1)
    # This is necessary because mount configurations are stage-specific
    apt_cache:
      type: auto-volume            # Use automatically managed Docker volume
      dst_path: /var/cache/apt     # APT cache directory in container

# Usage Notes:
# 1. APT cache persistence significantly speeds up repeated package installations
# 2. Home directory persistence preserves user settings, history, and development files
# 3. Mount configurations must be redefined in each stage (no inheritance)
# 4. Suitable for heavy development workloads with frequent package installations
# 5. GPU support enables CUDA development and GPU-accelerated applications
