# Minimal Ubuntu image with SSH support
# This is the simplest PeiDocker configuration for creating an Ubuntu container with SSH access

stage_1:
  # Base image configuration
  image:
    base: ubuntu:24.04              # Use Ubuntu 24.04 as the base image
    output: pei-minimal:stage-1     # Name of the generated stage-1 image
  
  # SSH server configuration
  ssh:
    enable: true                    # Enable SSH server in the container
    port: 22                       # SSH port inside the container (standard SSH port)
    host_port: 2222                # Port on host machine mapped to container SSH port
    
    # Define SSH users with their passwords
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'          # User 'me' with password '123456'
      you:
        password: '654321'          # User 'you' with password '654321'
      root:
        password: root              # Root user with password 'root'
  
  # Package repository configuration
  apt:
    repo_source: aliyun            # Use Aliyun mirror for faster package downloads in China
