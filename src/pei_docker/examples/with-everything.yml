# Usage Notes:
# 1. This configuration demonstrates every available PeiDocker option
# 2. Most real-world configurations will use a subset of these options
# 3. Custom scripts must be created in the corresponding directories
# 4. Storage directories are accessible as /soft/app, /soft/data, /soft/workspace
# 5. Environment variables are available to all scripts and applications
# 6. Scripts run in the order specified and can depend on previous scripts
