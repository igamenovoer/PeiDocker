# Welcome to PeiDocker

Don't keep your docker images around, keep the build files! If you ever want to make reproducible docker images but have no patience to learn Dockerfiles and docker-compose, PeiDocker is for you.

[PeiDocker (配 docker)](https://github.com/igamenovoer/PeiDocker) helps you script and organize your docker image building process without learning too much about Dockerfiles and docker-compose. It provides both CLI and web-based GUI for managing Docker projects with advanced features. With PeiDocker, you can:

- Build images with SSH support and multiple authentication methods
- Configure separate port mappings for system services (stage-1) and applications (stage-2)
- Use the intuitive web GUI for visual project configuration
- Export projects as ZIP files for easy sharing and backup
- Install packages from public repository using proxy
- Easily switch storage between Docker images, host directories, or volumes
- Run custom commands during image building and container lifecycle
- Manage environment variables with Docker Compose-style substitution

## What's New

### Recent Features (January 2025)

- **NiceGUI Web Interface**: New browser-based GUI for visual project management
- **Auto-port Selection**: GUI automatically finds available ports
- **Separate Port Mappings**: Independent port configuration for stage-1 (system) and stage-2 (application)
- **ZIP Export**: Export entire projects as ZIP files for sharing and backup
- **Enhanced SSH Options**: Support for inline SSH keys (public/private text)
- **Improved Architecture**: Modular codebase with better maintainability

## Installation

PeiDocker can be installed using pip or pixi (recommended):

### Using Pixi (Recommended)

```sh
# Install pixi if not already installed
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/igamenovoer/PeiDocker.git
cd PeiDocker

# Install project dependencies (this will also install the package in editable mode)
pixi install

# Run commands using pixi
pixi run pei-docker-cli create -p ./build
pixi run pei-docker-gui start
```

### Using pip

```sh
pip install click omegaconf attrs cattrs nicegui
```

## Quick Start

PeiDocker offers two ways to manage projects: via command line (CLI) or web interface (GUI).

### Option 1: Web GUI (Recommended for beginners)

The web-based GUI provides an intuitive interface for managing PeiDocker projects:

```sh
# Start the web GUI on an auto-selected free port
pei-docker-gui start

# Or specify a custom port
pei-docker-gui start --port 8080

# Load an existing project
pei-docker-gui start --project-dir /path/to/my/project

# Create a new project and jump to SSH configuration
pei-docker-gui start --project-dir /tmp/new-project --jump-to-page ssh
```

The web interface will open at `http://localhost:<port>` and provides:
- Visual project configuration with organized tabs
- Real-time validation and error checking
- Project import/export functionality (ZIP download)
- Interactive help and tooltips
- Separate port configuration for stage-1 and stage-2
- SSH key management with multiple authentication methods

### Option 2: Command Line Interface

* Create a new project:

```sh
# cd to the root of the git repository
cd /path/to/PeiDocker

# Create a new project in ./build or any other directory
pei-docker-cli create -p ./build

# Optional: Create without examples or contrib files
pei-docker-cli create -p ./build --no-with-examples --no-with-contrib
```

* Edit the configuration file `user_config.yml` in the project directory (e.g.,`./build`) according to your needs.
* Generate the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project directory:

```sh
# From within the project directory
cd ./build
pei-docker-cli configure

# Or specify project directory explicitly
pei-docker-cli configure -p ./build

# Optional: Use a different config file
pei-docker-cli configure -p ./build -c my-custom-config.yml

# Optional: Generate full compose file with extended sections
pei-docker-cli configure -p ./build -f
```

## CLI Commands Reference

### `create` command

Creates a new PeiDocker project with template files and examples.

```sh
pei-docker-cli create [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-p, --project-dir DIRECTORY`: Project directory (required)
- `-e, --with-examples`: Copy example files to the project dir (default: enabled)
- `--with-contrib`: Copy contrib directory to the project dir (default: enabled)
- `--help`: Show help message

**Examples:**
```sh
# Create project with all templates and examples
pei-docker-cli create -p ./my-project

# Create minimal project without examples
pei-docker-cli create -p ./minimal-project --no-with-examples --no-with-contrib
```

### `configure` command

Processes the configuration file and generates docker-compose.yml and related files.

```sh
pei-docker-cli configure [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-p, --project-dir DIRECTORY`: Project directory (default: current working directory)
- `-c, --config FILE`: Config file name, relative to the project dir (default: `user_config.yml`)
- `-f, --full-compose`: Generate full compose file with extended sections (default: false)
- `--help`: Show help message

**Examples:**
```sh
# Use current directory as project directory with default config
pei-docker-cli configure

# Use default config file (user_config.yml) in specific directory
pei-docker-cli configure -p ./my-project

# Use custom config file
pei-docker-cli configure -p ./my-project -c prod-config.yml

# Generate full compose file with extended sections
pei-docker-cli configure -p ./my-project -f

# Use current directory with custom config file
pei-docker-cli configure -c prod-config.yml
```

For detailed CLI options and advanced usage, see the [CLI Reference](cli_reference.md).

* Build the docker images. There are two images to be built, namely `stage-1` and `stage-2`. `stage-1` is intended to be a base image, installing system apps using `apt install`, `stage-2` is intended to be a final image based on `stage-1`, installing custom apps using downloaded packages like `.deb`. External storage is only available in `stage-2`.

```sh
cd ./build

# Using docker compose to build the images. 
# To see all the output, use --progress=plain
# To cleanly rebuild the images, use --no-cache

# Build the stage-1 image
# By default, the image is named pei-image:stage-1, you can change it in user_config.yml
docker compose build stage-1 --progress=plain

# Build the stage-2 image
# By default, the image is named pei-image:stage-2
docker compose build stage-2 --progress=plain
```

* Run the docker container:

```sh
# inside project directory, such as ./build

# Typically you will run the stage-2 container
# You can also up the stage-1 container as well.
docker compose up stage-2
```

* If you have setup SSH in `user_config.yml`, now you can SSH into the container:

```sh
# by default, it will create a user named `me` with password '123456'
# and map the port 2222 to the container's port 22

ssh me@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
```

* That's it, you are good to go.

For more detailed configuration options and advanced features, see the [Examples](examples/basic.md) section.

* If you prefer to run the image using `docker run` instead of `docker compose`, you can convert the `docker-compose.yml` to commands using [Decomposerize](https://www.decomposerize.com/).
* If you have trouble connecting to docker.io when building the image, you can either set the global proxy for docker, or pull the base image manually and tag it with a local name. For detail, see [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68520864/how-to-disable-loading-metadata-while-executing-docker-build).

```sh
# get the base image manually
docker pull ubuntu:24.04

# tag it with a local name, 
# in user_config.yml, use my-ubuntu:24.04 as the base image 
# to skip checking with docker.io
docker tag ubuntu:24.04 my-ubuntu:24.04
```

## Custom commands

* To run custom commands during build, edit the scripts in `<project_dir>/installation/stage-<1,2>/custom`. You can also run other scripts by adding them in `user_config.yml`.
* **Custom script parameters**: Scripts can accept shell-like parameters using quotes: `'script.sh --param=value --flag'`. Parameters are safely parsed and passed to scripts during execution.
* If you have *on-first-run* commands in `user_config.yml`, after the first run, you shall commit the container to a new image so that the changes are saved, or otherwise those commands will be executed again when the container is recreated.

## Stage-2 storage

The image built in stage-2 have the following directories for user:

- `/soft/app`: the directory to store the installed apps.
- `/soft/data`: the directory to store the data files.
- `/soft/workspace`: the directory to store the workspace files, like code.

These `/soft/xxx` are links to the corresponding directories in `/hard/image/xxx` (in-image storage) or `/hard/volume/xxx` (external storage), where content is actually stored, based on the following rules:

- If `/hard/volume/xxx` is found, then `/soft/xxx` is a link to `/hard/volume/xxx`.
- Otherwise, if `/hard/image/xxx` is found, then `/soft/xxx` is a link to `/hard/image/xxx`.

As such, you can switch between in-image storage and external storage by mounting into `/hard/volume/xxx`, and this behavious is already present in the generated `docker-compose.yml` file based on your `user_config.yml`. Note that only predefined directories (`app`, `data`, `workspace`) are linked, others will be ignored.

## Project directory layout

Inside your project directory, you will find the following files and directories:

    compose-template.yml    # the template for docker-compose.yml, do not modify this file
    stage-1.Dockerfile      # the Dockerfile for stage-1 image, do not modify this file
    stage-2.Dockerfile      # the Dockerfile for stage-2 image, do not modify this file
    user_config.yml         # the configuration file, edit this file to customize
    installation/           # this directory will be copied into the image under /pei-from-host
        stage-1/            # the scripts to run during stage-1 image building
            custom/         # the custom scripts to run during stage-1 image building, you need to explicitly list them in user_config.yml
            tmp/            # the temporary directory to store downloaded packages, like .deb, .whl, etc.
            system/         # the configuration files for system apps, like apt, pip, etc.
            ...
        stage-2/            # the scripts to run during stage-2 image building
            custom/         # the custom scripts to run during stage-2 image building, you need to explicitly list them in user_config.yml
            tmp/            # the temporary directory to store downloaded packages, like .deb, .whl, etc.
            system/         # the configuration files for system apps, like apt, pip, etc.
            ...

## User configuration file

Here are the options you can set in `user_config.yml`:

```yaml
