## Basic Ubuntu image with SSH support

This is the most basic example of creating an image with SSH support. The image is based on `ubuntu:24.04` and has three users: `me`, `you`, and `root`. The passwords for the users are `123456`, `654321`, and `root` respectively. The SSH server is running on port `22` and mapped to host port `2222`. 

To accelerate apt installation in China, the `apt` source is set to `tuna`. For other options, see the full [config file](../index.md) for documentation. If this option is omitted, the default source will be used.

```yaml
# user_config.yml under project directory

stage_1:
  image:
    base: ubuntu:24.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      you:
        password: '654321'
      root:
        password: root
  apt:
    repo_source: tuna
```

With this `user_config.yml` in side your project dir, do the followings to build and run the image:

```bash
# assuming the project dir is /path/to/project

python -m pei_docker.pei configure --project-dir=/path/to/project

cd /path/to/project
docker compose build stage-1 --progress=plain --no-cache
docker compose up stage-1
```

### With docker run
If you prefer to use `docker run` to run the image, you can copy-paste the `docker-compose.yml` file into [Decomposerize](https://www.decomposerize.com/) to get the `docker run` command. The command will look like this:

```bash
docker run -i -t --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway -p 2222:22 pei-image:stage-1 /bin/bash
```

## GPU image with external storage

This example is based on [the basic ssh image](#basic-ssh), which demonstrates how to use GPU in the container. The image is based on `nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04` that makes use of the GPU. As such, the `device` section is added to the `stage_1` and `stage_2` sections, which are set to `gpu`.

```yaml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      root:
        password: root
  apt:
    repo_source: tuna
  device:
    type: gpu
stage_2:
  image:
    output: pei-image:stage-2
  device:
    type: gpu
  storage:
    app:
      type: host
      host_path: d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/app
    data:
      type: host
      host_path: d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/data
    workspace:
      type: host
      host_path: d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/workspace
```

### External storage with host directory

The `stage-2` image has three external storage directories: `app`, `data`, and `workspace` (note that the directory names are **NOT CUSTOMIZABLE**, for arbitrary mounts, see [the next section](#mount-additional-volumes)), where specified host directories are mounted. In the container, you can access these directories through `/soft/app`, `/soft/data`, and `/soft/workspace`, which are linked to  `/app`, `/data`, and `/workspace` under the `/hard/volume`. In this example, the host directories are `d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/app`, `d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/data`, and `d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/workspace` (Windows path).

[](){#mount-additional-volumes}
### Mounting arbitrary volumes or directories

You can mount additional volumes or directories to the container by adding them to the `mount` section. The following example demonstrates how to mount the `apt_cache` directory to the container's `/var/cache/apt` directory, in this way, the apt cache will be saved for future use. `home_me` is mounted to `/home/me` to save the home directory to a volume, so that it will not get lost after the container is deleted. 

Unlike `app`, `data`, and `workspace`, the mounted volumes `apt_cache` and `home_me` will not be linked to `/soft`, they are mounted directly to the container and not managed by PeiDocker. You can also use `manual-volume` (with `volume_name` set) or `host` (with `host_path` set) in ther `type` though.

```yaml
# heavy duty cpp development, install a lot of things

stage_1:
  # input/output image settings
  image:
    base: nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-runtime-ubuntu22.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1

  # ssh settings
  ssh:
    port: 22  # port in container
    host_port: 2222  # port in host

    # ssh users, the key is user name, value is user info
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      root: # you can configure root user here
        password: root
        pubkey_file: null

  device:
    type: gpu

  apt:
    repo_source: 'tuna'

  # additional mounts
  mount:
    # save apt cache, to speed up future installations
    apt_cache:
      type: auto-volume
      dst_path: /var/cache/apt
    
stage_2:
  image:
    output: pei-image:stage-2
  device:
    type: gpu

  # additional mounts
  mount:
    # save home directory to volume, so that it will not get lost after container deletion
    home_me:
      type: auto-volume
      dst_path: /home/me

    # mount will not be inherited from stage-1
    # you need to mount it again, or otherwise it will not be mounted
    apt_cache:
      type: auto-volume
      dst_path: /var/cache/apt
```

### With docker-compose

To build and run the image, do the followings:

```bash
# assuming the project dir is /path/to/project

# build stage-1
docker compose -f /path/to/project/docker-compose.yml build stage-1 --progress=plain --no-cache

# build stage-2
docker compose -f /path/to/project/docker-compose.yml build stage-2 --progress=plain --no-cache

# start stage-2
docker compose -f /path/to/project/docker-compose.yml up stage-2
```

After that, you can ssh into the container with the following command:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 me@127.0.0.1
```


### With docker run

If you are using `docker run` to run the image, you can copy-paste the `docker-compose.yml` file into [Decomposerize](https://www.decomposerize.com/) to get the `docker run` command. The command will look like this, note that you need to add `--gpus all` manually:

```bash
# you only need to run stage-2
docker run --gpus all -i -t --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway -p 2222:22 -v d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/app:/hard/volume/app -v d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/data:/hard/volume/data -v d:/code/PeiDocker/build/storage/workspace:/hard/volume/workspace pei-image:stage-2 /bin/bash
```

[](){#external-storage}
## Using docker volume as external storage

Using [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) is preferred if you run the image locally, because it is more efficient, and will not get lost when the container is removed. Docker volumes can be created automatically, or [manually](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/volume/create/) with a given name that can be used to mount the volume to the container. 

This example is based on [the basic ssh image](#basic-ssh), which demonstrates how to use existing docker volumes as external storage. The `stage-2` image has three external storage directories: `app`, `data`, and `workspace` (note that the directory names are **NOT CUSTOMIZABLE**, they are **predefined**), where **docker volumes** are mounted. 


```yaml
# user_config.yml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: ubuntu:24.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
  apt:
    repo_source: tuna
stage_2:
  image:
    output: pei-image:stage-2
  storage:
    app:
      type: auto-volume
    data:
      type: manual-volume
      volume_name: my_data
    workspace:
      type: manual-volume
      volume_name: my_workspace
```

`app` is an **auto-volume**, which means it will be created automatically. `data` and `workspace` are **manual-volumes**, which means they are created manually with the names `my_data` and `my_workspace` first, and then mounted to the container. To create these volumes, use the following commands

```bash
docker volume create my_data
docker volume create my_workspace
``` 

You can check the volumes with `docker volume ls`.

If you are using the [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on Windows, you will see this:

![docker desktop volumes](../images/docker-desktop-volumes.png)

In the container, you can access these directories through `/soft/app`, `/soft/data`, and `/soft/workspace`, which are linked to  `/app`, `/data`, and `/workspace` under the `/hard/volume`.


### With docker run

If you are using `docker run` to run the image, you can copy-paste the `docker-compose.yml` file into [Decomposerize](https://www.decomposerize.com/) to get the `docker run` command. Note that you will have to create all volumes manully. The command will look like this:

```bash
# using docker run, you will have to create all volumes manually
docker volume create app
docker volume create my_data
docker volume create my_workspace
docker run -i -t --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway -p 2222:22 -v app:/hard/volume/app -v data:/hard/volume/data -v workspace:/hard/volume/workspace pei-image:stage-2 /bin/bash

# you don't need to run stage-1
# docker run -i -t --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway -p 2222:22 pei-image:stage-1 /bin/bash
```

[](){#miniconda-in-image}
## Install miniconda in image

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The following example is for demonstration purposes only. It is **not recommended** to install miniconda (or any other apps) in the image, because it will make the image size larger, and later modifications (such as `conda install xxx`) will get lost when container is removed. It is recommended to install miniconda in the volume storage `/hard/volume/app`, and copy them to the image storage `/hard/image/app` when you decide to bake them into image. However, **external storage only exists in stage-2**.

To install miniconda during build, you can make use of custom scripts. PeiDocker allows you to add your scripts in the `project_dir/installation/stage-<1,2>/custom`, and then specify them in the `user_config.yml` file.

```yaml
# user_config.yml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-runtime-ubuntu22.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      root:
        password: root
  apt:
    repo_source: tuna
  device:
    type: gpu
stage_2:
  image:
    output: pei-image:stage-2
  device:
    type: gpu
  storage:
    app:
      type: image
    data:
      type: image
    workspace:
      type: image
  custom:
    on_build:
    - stage-2/system/conda/auto-install-miniconda.sh
```

In the above example, the script `auto-install-miniconda.sh` is placed in the `project_dir/installation/stage-2/system/conda` directory. The script will be executed during the build of the `stage-2` image. Below is the content of the script. It first checks if the miniconda installation file exists in the `/tmp` directory, and if not, downloads it from the tuna mirror. Then it installs miniconda to `/hard/image/app/miniconda3`, and initializes conda for all users. The conda and pip mirrors are set to the tuna mirror. Important points to note:

- Custom script can be placed anywhere in the project directory, but it is recommended to put them in the `project_dir/installation/stage-<1,2>/custom` directory. Locations like `xxx/system` are managed by official developers, and may be overwritten in future updates.
- The package files are placed in the `project_dir/installation/stage-2/tmp` directory.
- You can access the installation directory of the `stage-2` image using the `PEI_STAGE_DIR_2` environment variable, likewise for `stage-1`. Note it will try to use external storage `\hard\volume\app` first, but because you have not mounted any external storage, it will use the image storage `\hard\image\app`.
- During build, you are root, so you shall execute commands for other users using `su - $user -c`.
- Remember to set DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive to prevent interactive prompts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# prevent interactive prompts
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# PEI_STAGE_DIR_2 points to where the installation/stage-2 is inside container

## Install miniconda to external storage

To install miniconda to external storage, you can mount external storage ([How to use external storage?][external-storage]) to the `/hard/volume/app`, so that the miniconda installation will be saved there. The following example demonstrates how to install miniconda to the external storage.

First, create a docker volume named `my_app`:

```bash
docker volume create my_app
```

Then, modify the `user_config.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-runtime-ubuntu22.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      root:
        password: root
  apt:
    repo_source: tuna
  device:
    type: gpu
stage_2:
  image:
    output: pei-image:stage-2
  device:
    type: gpu
  storage:
    app:
      type: manual-volume
      volume_name: my_app
    data:
      type: auto-volume
    workspace:
      type: auto-volume
  custom:
    on_first_run:
    - stage-2/system/conda/auto-install-miniconda.sh
```

The example is based on [Install miniconda in image][miniconda-in-image], with the following changes:
- `app` is a **manual-volume**, which means it is created manually with the name `my_app`, and then mounted to the container. To create it, use `docker volume create my_app`.
- `data` and `workspace` are **auto-volumes**, which means they are created automatically.
- The `install-my-conda.sh` script is executed on the first run of the container, to install miniconda3 and setup conda for all users.

**IMPORTANT**: Here comes the critical part for using `on_first_run` commands. After the commands are run, they modify the **container**, not the **image**. If you want to save the changes to the image, you need to commit the container to the image. If you forgot to do that, changes are not saved, and the first-run commands will be run again when the container is recreated. 

To correct this, commit the container to the image after the first run:

```bash
docker commit <container_id> pei-image:stage-2
```

## Moving external storage to image

After you have installed apps to the external storage, you can move it to the image storage. This is useful when you want to bake the installed apps into the image. To do this, just copy the files from the external storage to the image storage. Inside the container, do the followings:

```bash
# inside container
# just copy /hard/volume/app to /hard/image/app, likewise for other directories
cp -r /hard/volume/app /hard/image/app

# for data and workspace, if you want to bake them into the image
# cp -r /hard/volume/data /hard/image/data
# cp -r /hard/volume/workspace /hard/image/workspace
```

And then, commit your container to image:
  
```bash
docker commit <container_id> pei-image:stage-2
```

## Using proxy

You can use proxy when building the image. The following example demonstrates how to use proxy for `stage_1`. The proxy is set to `host.docker.internal:30080`, which refers to `127.0.0.1:30080` in host where the proxy is running. The `apt` is specified to use the proxy, and the proxy is kept after the build.

```yaml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: ubuntu:24.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      you:
        password: '654321'
      root:
        password: root
  proxy:
    address: host.docker.internal
    port: 30080
    enable_globally: false  # if set to true, the proxy is used during build and run
    remove_after_build: false # if set to true, the proxy is removed after build, not effecting run
    use_https: false  # false means http proxy is used where https proxy is requested
  apt:
    use_proxy: true   # use the proxy for apt
    keep_proxy_after_build: true  # keep apt using the proxy after build
```

### Using proxy during build and run

This example shows how to use proxy during build and run. The key is to set `enable_globally` to `true`. If you set `remove_after_build` to `true`, the proxy will be removed after the build, and not effecting the run, this is useful if you only want to use the proxy during build (e.g., pulling sources from github).

```yaml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: ubuntu:24.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      you:
        password: '654321'
      root:
        password: root
  proxy:
    address: host.docker.internal
    port: 30080
    enable_globally: true
    remove_after_build: false
    use_https: false
  apt:
    repo_source: tuna
```

### Using proxy across stages

This example shows how to use proxy across stages. The proxy is set in `stage-1`, but only used for `apt`. In `stage-2`, the proxy is enabled globally, affecting all commands after run. 

```yaml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: ubuntu:24.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      you:
        password: '654321'
      root:
        password: root
  proxy:
    address: host.docker.internal
    port: 30080
    enable_globally: false
    remove_after_build: false
    use_https: false
  apt:
    use_proxy: true
    keep_proxy_after_build: true
stage_2:
  image:
    output: pei-image:stage-2
  proxy:
    enable_globally: true
```

You can verify the proxy is set by running `env` after ssh into the container.

```sh
# inside container
env | grep -i proxy

# you should see the proxy settings
# http_proxy=http://host.docker.internal:30080
# https_proxy=http://host.docker.internal:30080
```

### Using proxy manually

If you specify the proxy, but never use it, it will not automatically affect anything. But you can find the proxy setting in the container, using environment variables `PEI_HTTP_PROXY_1` and `PEI_HTTPS_PROXY_1` (replace `1` with the stage number). 

```yaml
stage_1:
  image:
    base: ubuntu:24.04
    output: pei-image:stage-1
  ssh:
    enable: true
    port: 22
    host_port: 2222
    users:
      me:
        password: '123456'
      you:
        password: '654321'
      root:
        password: root
  proxy:
    address: host.docker.internal
    port: 30080
  apt:
    repo_source: tuna
```

After ssh into the container, you can find the proxy settings:

```sh
