# Pixi Support Implementation Summary

## Task Overview
The user requested implementation of pixi package manager support in PeiDocker, specifically:

1. **Initial Request**: Create a script to use pixi to create a global environment named `ml` and install machine learning packages
2. **Package List**: scipy, networkx, trimesh, pytorch, torchvision, click, attrs, omegaconf, open3d, pyvista, pyvistaqt, mkdocs-material, pyqt, opencv
3. **Location Update**: Move scripts from `stage-1/system/pixi` to `stage-2/system/pixi` to enable access to both `/hard/volume` and `/hard/image` storage options

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made

1. **Updated install-pixi.bash**:
   - Added logic to check for `/hard/volume/app` first (stage-2 volume storage)
   - Falls back to `/hard/image/app` if volume storage unavailable
   - Updated PATH configuration to handle both possible installation locations

2. **Created create-env-ml.bash**:
   - Script to install ML packages using `pixi global install`
   - Installs all packages in one command (user corrected initial approach)
   - Checks both possible pixi installation paths

3. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Follows same pattern as miniforge installation
   - Prioritizes `/hard/volume/app/pixi` in stage-2
   - Falls back to `/hard/image/app/pixi` for image storage

## User Prompts Summary

1. "in @pei_docker/project_files/installation/stage-1/system/pixi/create-env-ml.bash , use pixi to create a global environment named `ml`, and then install the following packages: scipy, networkx, trimesh, pytorch, torchvision, click, attrs, omegaconf, open3d, pyvista, pyvistaqt, mkdocs-material, pyqt, opencv. You may need to first check online about how to use pixi, and the pixi was installed by @context/hints/install-pixi-custom-location.md"

2. "pixi global install can install multiple packages in one go"

3. "read the docs about the path management of the PeiDocker tool. Note that I have moved the stage-1/system/pixi to stage-2/system/pixi, because of that, it is assumed to be used in stage-2, then it can access `/hard/volume` and `/hard/image` based on the situation, like @pei_docker/project_files/installation/stage-2/system/conda/auto-install-miniforge.sh . As such, update the pixi installation scripts in @pei_docker/project_files/installation/stage-2/system/pixi/"

4. "summarize what I told you to do, particularly my prompts, and save it to the @context/tasks/ dir, create a subdir named `pixi-support` for this"
