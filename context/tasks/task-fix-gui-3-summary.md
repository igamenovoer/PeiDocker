# Task Fix GUI-3: Summary of Completed Work

## Problem Fixed
The Scripts tab was losing inline script editor content when users navigated to other tabs and returned. This was because the tab wasn't using NiceGUI's data binding features to persist state.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated UI State Model
Modified `ScriptsUI` in `ui_state.py` to store all script configuration:
- Entry point modes and content for both stages
- Lifecycle scripts as structured data (Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]])
- Separate fields for file paths and inline script content

### 2. Refactored Scripts Tab
Completely rewrote `scripts.py` to use data binding:
- Used `bind_value()` for all input fields
- Used `bind_visibility_from()` for conditional UI elements
- Stored lifecycle scripts in the UI model instead of just UI references
- Implemented proper loading and saving from the model

### 3. Key Technical Changes
- Entry point radio buttons now bind to `stage1_entry_mode` / `stage2_entry_mode`
- File path inputs bind to `stage1_entry_file_path` / `stage2_entry_file_path`
- Inline script names and content bind to respective fields
- Lifecycle scripts stored as structured data with proper updates on edit

## Other Findings

### Tabs NOT Using Data Binding
Investigation revealed that most other tabs are also not using data binding:
- **Environment Tab**: Manually manages state with input event handlers
- **Network Tab**: No binding, uses manual state updates
- **SSH Tab**: No binding, complex user management without model persistence  
- **Storage Tab**: No binding, manual volume/mount management
- **Project Tab**: Partial binding to legacy models

### Type Safety Issues
MyPy revealed that the current app uses `legacy_models.py` (AppData) instead of `ui_state.py` (AppUIState), causing type errors when trying to access `self.app.ui_state`.

## Created Comprehensive Refactoring Plan
Created `task-refactor-webgui-data-binding.md` with a detailed plan to:
1. Replace legacy models with proper UI state models
2. Implement data binding across all tabs
3. Create a bridge layer between UI models and config models
4. Ensure type safety throughout the application
5. Handle complex data types (lists, dicts) properly

## Immediate Impact
The Scripts tab now properly preserves:
- Entry point mode selections
- File paths for script references
- Inline script names and content
- All lifecycle scripts and their configurations

Users can now freely navigate between tabs without losing any script configuration data.
