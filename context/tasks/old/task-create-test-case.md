# Create Test Cases For GUI Tests

we need to prepare a set of test cases that cover the implemented features of the GUI application, focus on correctness ONLY.

## Goal

- create a set of test cases for the GUI application for automatic testing, each case a file in the `context/plans/gui/testcase`
- test case specification is in `context\hints\about-test-case-spec.md`, you DO NOT need to include all sections in your test cases, just pick the most relevant ones, which is DIRECTLY related to the GUI application's CORRECTNESS.

## Relevant Files

- `context\tasks\task-gui-new.md`, the original task description, have a look at it to understand the original requirements. If anything conflicts with this requirements, this requirement takes precedence.
- `context\plans\gui\gui-simple-mode.md`, the plan for the simple mode GUI

## Rules

- DO NOT use unicode emojis in the test cases logging.
- NOT NEED to test networking functionality
