# Guidelines for Revising Documentation

## User Comments

User may give explicit instructions on how to revise the document, which should be followed carefully. The comments may include:

- user's comments are given in the form `[[user-comment: details]]`
  - `[[DEL]]` means to delete the referred content
  - `[[ADD]]` means to add the referred content
  - `[[MARK-BEGIN]]` and `[[MARK-END]]` are used to mark sections for modification
  - `[[NOTE: details]]` says about modifications that should be made to the document

- hierarchy of comments should be handled like this:
  - if a comment is given on a section and subsections, the comment in the subsection takes precedence over the comment in the parent section, if in conflict. If no conflict, both comments should be applied.

- after processing the comments, the comments should be removed from the document
