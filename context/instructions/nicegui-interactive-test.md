you are tasked to test a web GUI application developed with `nicegui` using browser directly, follow these instructions

# Interactive Test Instructions

- read this guide for many testing techniques: `context\hints\nicegui-kb\howto-test-nicegui-with-playwright.md`
- in the source code, make the necessary changes to ease the GUI testing, like adding `testid` to the buttons or other interactive elements.
- you MUST open a browser using `playwright` or `pytest-playwright` to run the tests, as it is the only way to verify the GUI functionality
- you SHOULD always open the GUI in a new browser, that browser is only for testing, you can close it after the test is done
- if you encouter any issues, you can get the html to verify the GUI state.
- temporary files can be created in `<workspace>/tmp`
