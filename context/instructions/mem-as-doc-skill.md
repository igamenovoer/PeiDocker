# Memroize as Documentation Skill

you are tasked to memorize something that is about documentation, for example, how to write a README, how to document a function, or how to write a comment, etc. These skills are not specific to the project, but rather general skills that can be applied across different projects and contexts.

## Documentation Skill Memory Guidelines

- ALWAYS state explicitly that the memory is about documentation skill, using a header like `# Documentation Skill Memory` at the beginning of your memory section.

- Documentation skills can be applied across different projects and contexts, so you need to abstract away the project-specific details, like using placeholders or specific items, and state things in general terms.
