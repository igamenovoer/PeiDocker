create a documentation about which file does what in the given dir

# Guidelines for File Summaries
- output to `context\summaries`, name it as `lsfiles-<dirname>-<date-and-time>.md`, unless specified otherwise
- create a file tree for the given dir, and briefly describe the purpose of each file
  - for source code files, include major functions or classes and their purpose
  - for configuration files, describe the settings or parameters they control
- by default, do this for unlimited depth, unless specified otherwise
