# Memorize Engineering Skills

you are tasked to memorize engineering skills, which are about principles and practices (like debugging, logging, organizing files, etc) in software engineering. 

Follow these guidelines to memorize:

## Engineering Skills Memorization Guidelines

- ALWAYS state explicitly that you are memorizing engineering skills, using a header like `# Engineering Skill Memory` to the memory section you are going to write.

- Engineering skills can be applied across different projects and contexts, so you need to abstract away the project-specific details, like using placeholders or specific items, and state things in general terms.
