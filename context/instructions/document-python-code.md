you are asked to document the Python code given in command, or python code to be implemented. Document them following these guidelines:

# Python Code Documentation Guidelines

- the preferred format is reStructuredText (reST), see `context\hints\about-numpy-restructuredtext-docstring-style.md` for details
- if the code is already documented, then review and update it with the preferred format
- give some summary info about the code, as comment in the beginning of the file. 
- - For CLI applications, the summary should include the command line usage, and the options available
- - For class and function definitions, the summary should include the purpose of the class or function, and function signature
