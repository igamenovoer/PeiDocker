# Memorizing as a Tool Skill

When you are tasked to memorize something that about a tool, for example, how to use a library, a programming language feature, cli commands, or a framework, etc. These tools are not specific to the project, but rather general skills that can be applied across different projects and contexts.

Follow these guidelines to write your memory.

## Tool Skill Memory Guidelines

- Always attempt to memorize the best practices of using the given tool, if not sure, check `context7` and online resources.
- Tool skills can be applied across different projects and contexts, so you need to abstract away the project-specific details, like using placeholders or specific items, and state things in general terms.
- ALWAYS state explicitly that the memory is a tool skill, use a mark like `# Tool Skill Memory` at the beginning of your memory section.
