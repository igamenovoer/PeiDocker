# Test Log: TC-WIZARD-001 Improved Implementation

**Test Case ID**: TC-WIZARD-001-IMPROVED
**Test Objective**: Test complete wizard flow with improved Textual testing patterns
**Test Scope**: PeiDockerApp, wizard navigation, configuration management
**Test Type**: Improved headless testing with proper timing and fallback approaches
**Status**: PARTIAL_PASS

## Test Execution Summary

**Total Steps**: 11
**Completed**: 10
**Failed**: 1

## Test Results:

### 1. Complete Wizard Flow (Improved)
**Completed**: 7 **Failed**: 1
- ✓ App started successfully in test mode
- ✓ Initial app mounting completed
- ✓ Simple mode wizard initiated
- ✓ Navigated to step 2
- ✓ Navigated to step 3
- ✓ Navigated to step 4
- ✓ ESC key handling works
- ! State check failed: 'PeiDockerApp' object has no attribute 'current_screen'

### 2. Wizard Component Validation
**Completed**: 3 **Failed**: 0
- ✓ ProjectConfig creation and assignment works
- ✓ Configuration serialization available
- ✓ SSH configuration management works

## Improvements Made

Based on Textual documentation research:
- Added proper `pilot.pause()` calls to wait for UI operations
- Used keyboard navigation instead of unreliable button clicks
- Implemented fallback component testing approach
- Added proper screen size configuration
- Improved error handling and state validation

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works Better:
- Keyboard navigation (`pilot.press()`) is more reliable than button clicks
- `pilot.pause()` prevents timing-related failures
- Component validation provides reliable fallback testing
- Proper screen sizing improves test stability

### ⚠️ Remaining Challenges:
- Full end-to-end navigation still faces UI mounting issues
- Element querying in headless mode remains problematic
- Screen transitions require more sophisticated timing

## Test Conclusion

The improved approach **PARTIALLY PASSED** with better reliability than the original implementation.

The combination of keyboard-based navigation and component validation provides more comprehensive coverage while working within the limitations of Textual's headless testing environment.
