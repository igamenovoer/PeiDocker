# Code Review: Wizard Controller (SC-2) and Project Info Screen (SC-3)

**Date:** 2025-07-28
**Reviewer:** Cline (AI Code Reviewer)

This report covers the review of the Simple Wizard Controller (`SimpleWizardScreen`) and the first wizard step, the Project Information screen (`ProjectInfoWidget`), comparing their implementation against the provided design documents and general best practices for the Wizard UI pattern.

## SC-2: Simple Wizard Controller (`src/pei_docker/gui/screens/simple/wizard.py`)

The implementation in `wizard.py` successfully acts as the controller (SC-2) for the wizard flow, aligning well with the design specification.

### Positive Observations

*   **Centralized Logic:** The `SimpleWizardScreen` class effectively centralizes the core wizard logic, including step management, navigation, and progress tracking, as intended by the design.
*   **State Management:** The controller correctly manages the `project_config` object, passing it down to each step, which aligns with the "memory-first" state management principle outlined in the design.
*   **Dynamic Step Loading:** The implementation dynamically loads and caches step screens (`self.step_screens`), which is an efficient approach.
*   **Clear Separation:** The `WizardStep` class provides a clean way to define the sequence and properties of each step in the wizard.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Redundant Navigation Button Updates:**
    *   **Observation:** The `_update_step` method calls both `_update_step_content` and `_recreate_navigation_buttons`. However, `_recreate_navigation_buttons` is complex and removes/re-adds buttons, which can cause flickering. The logic in `_update_navigation_buttons` is also complex.
    *   **Suggestion:** Simplify the navigation updates. Instead of recreating buttons, have permanent "Prev", "Next", and "Save" buttons in the layout and simply toggle their `visible` and `disabled` properties. This is more efficient and aligns better with Textual's reactive nature.

    ```python
    # In compose()
    yield Button("Prev", id="prev", variant="default")
    yield Button("Next", id="next", variant="primary")
    yield Button("Save", id="save", variant="success", classes="-hidden") # Start hidden
    yield Button("Cancel", id="cancel", variant="default")

    # In _update_step()
    def _update_step(self) -> None:
        # ... (update title and progress)
        
        is_last_step = self.current_step >= len(self.steps) - 1
        self.query_one("#prev", Button).disabled = self.current_step == 0
        self.query_one("#next", Button).display = is_last_step
        self.query_one("#save", Button).display = not is_last_step

        self._update_step_content()
    ```

2.  **Escape Key Handling:**
    *   **Observation:** The `action_handle_escape` uses a timer (`set_timer`) to detect a double-press. This is a common pattern, but can sometimes feel unresponsive.
    *   **Suggestion:** This is a minor point, but an alternative could be to check the time delta between escape presses. However, the current implementation is acceptable and functional.

3.  **Validation Call:**
    *   **Observation:** The `action_next` method calls `_validate_current_step`, which correctly checks for an `is_valid` method on the step widget. This is good.
    *   **Suggestion:** Ensure all step widgets consistently implement the `is_valid` method for this pattern to be robust.

## SC-3: Project Information Screen (`src/pei_docker/gui/screens/simple/project_info.py`)

The `project_info.py` file correctly implements the first step of the wizard.

### Positive Observations

*   **Component Structure:** The code correctly separates concerns into a data class (`ProjectInfoConfig`), `Validator` classes, and a `Widget` (`ProjectInfoWidget`). This makes the code modular and testable.
*   **Validation:** The use of custom `Validator` classes (`ProjectNameValidator`, `DockerImageValidator`) is a clean and reusable way to handle input validation, fully aligned with Textual's capabilities.
*   **Reactive UI:** The use of `reactive` variables and `watch` methods for the image preview is a great example of leveraging Textual's features for a responsive UI.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Code Duplication (`ProjectInfoScreen` vs. `ProjectInfoWidget`):**
    *   **Observation:** The file defines both a `ProjectInfoScreen` and a `ProjectInfoWidget`. The `SimpleWizardScreen` controller uses `ProjectInfoWidget`. This makes the `ProjectInfoScreen` class redundant and adds maintenance overhead.
    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the `ProjectInfoScreen` class entirely. The `ProjectInfoWidget` is the component actually being used in the wizard and should be the single source of truth for this UI step.

2.  **Configuration Handling:**
    *   **Observation:** The `ProjectInfoWidget` creates its own `ProjectInfoConfig` instance. While it syncs with the main `project_config` from the controller, this creates two sources of truth.
    *   **Suggestion:** The step widget should directly modify the `project_config` object passed from the `SimpleWizardScreen` controller. This ensures a single, consistent state model throughout the wizard. The `ProjectInfoConfig` data class can be removed, and its validation logic can be moved into the `ProjectInfoWidget`'s `is_valid` method or kept in separate validation functions.

    ```python
    # In ProjectInfoWidget
    def __init__(self, project_config: 'ProjectConfig') -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.project_config = project_config # Directly use the controller's config
        # ...
    
    @on(Input.Changed, "#project_name")
    def on_project_name_changed(self, event: Input.Changed) -> None:
        """Handle project name input changes."""
        self.project_config.project_name = event.value
        # ... update preview
    ```

3.  **CSS Specificity:**
    *   **Observation:** The CSS in `ProjectInfoWidget` is well-structured.
    *   **Suggestion:** To avoid potential style conflicts in a larger application, consider making the CSS selectors more specific to the widget, for example by wrapping them inside `ProjectInfoWidget { ... }`. The current implementation is fine for this project's scale.

## Summary

The implementation of the wizard controller and the first step is solid and largely follows the design specifications. The architecture correctly applies the Wizard UI pattern.

The main recommendations are to refactor for simplification and to reduce code duplication:
1.  **Simplify navigation button logic** in `SimpleWizardScreen`.
2.  **Remove the redundant `ProjectInfoScreen` class** in `project_info.py`.
3.  **Refactor `ProjectInfoWidget` to directly manipulate the shared `project_config` object** instead of maintaining its own `ProjectInfoConfig` instance.

These changes will make the codebase more maintainable, efficient, and more tightly aligned with the single-source-of-truth principle for state management.
