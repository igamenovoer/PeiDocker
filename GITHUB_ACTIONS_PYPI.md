# GitHub Actions PyPI Publishing Workflow

## 🚀 Automated PyPI Publishing Setup Complete!

The repository now has a fully configured GitHub Actions workflow that automatically publishes releases to PyPI.

## 📋 Workflow Configuration

**File:** `.github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml`

**Trigger:** Automatically runs when a GitHub release is published

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Checks out the repository code
2. ✅ Sets up Python 3.11 environment
3. ✅ Installs build tools (build, twine)
4. ✅ Builds the package (both wheel and source distribution)
5. ✅ Validates the package using twine check
6. ✅ Publishes to PyPI using the stored API token

## 🔑 Security Setup

- ✅ **PyPI API Token** securely stored as GitHub secret `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
- ✅ Token format: `pypi-AgEI...` (starts with pypi-AgEI)
- ✅ No sensitive information exposed in the workflow file

## 🔄 How to Trigger the Workflow

The workflow automatically triggers when you **publish a release** on GitHub:

### Method 1: Via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to: https://github.com/igamenovoer/PeiDocker/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Choose a tag version (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
4. Add release title and notes
5. Click "Publish release"
6. ➡️ Workflow automatically starts!

### Method 2: Via GitHub CLI
```bash
# Create and publish a new release
gh release create v1.0.1 --title "v1.0.1: Bug fixes and improvements" --notes "Release notes here..."

# The workflow will automatically trigger
```

### Method 3: Re-trigger for Existing Release
If you need to re-publish the current v1.0.0 release:
```bash
# Delete and recreate the release (this will trigger the workflow)
gh release delete v1.0.0 --yes
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "v1.0.0: Production Release with Web GUI" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

## 📊 Monitoring the Workflow

### Check Workflow Status:
```bash
# List all workflows
gh workflow list

# View recent runs
gh run list --workflow="Publish to PyPI"

# View detailed logs of the latest run
gh run view --log
```

### GitHub Web Interface:
Visit: https://github.com/igamenovoer/PeiDocker/actions

## ✅ Workflow Benefits

1. **Fully Automated:** No manual PyPI uploads needed
2. **Secure:** API tokens stored safely as GitHub secrets
3. **Validated:** Package integrity checked before upload
4. **Release-Triggered:** Only publishes on official releases
5. **Traceable:** Full logs and history in GitHub Actions

## 🧪 Testing the Workflow

Since the existing v1.0.0 release was created before the workflow, you can test it by:

1. **Option A:** Create a new version (recommended)
   ```bash
   # Update version in pyproject.toml to 1.0.1
   # Make any minor changes/fixes
   # Commit and create new release
   ```

2. **Option B:** Re-create v1.0.0 release
   ```bash
   gh release delete v1.0.0 --yes
   gh release create v1.0.0 --title "v1.0.0: Production Release with Web GUI" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After publishing a release, you should see:
- ✅ Package appears on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pei-docker/
- ✅ GitHub Actions run completes successfully
- ✅ Release is linked to the published PyPI version

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails:
1. Check the Actions logs: https://github.com/igamenovoer/PeiDocker/actions
2. Verify the PyPI API token is still valid
3. Ensure version number in `pyproject.toml` is unique (not already on PyPI)
4. Check package build integrity

The workflow is now ready and will automatically handle all future releases! 🎉
