        "PeiDocker WebGUI Model Refactoring Analysis (2025-08-05):\n\nCRITICAL DISCOVERY - attrs vs Pydantic Incompatibility:\n- CLI uses attrs library (@define decorators) for models in user_config.py\n- WebGUI uses Pydantic (BaseModel) for models in webgui/models/config.py\n- Direct inheritance IMPOSSIBLE due to metaclass conflicts\n- Different validation mechanisms: __attrs_post_init__ vs @field_validator\n\nARCHITECTURAL SOLUTION - Dual-Model with Converters:\nInstead of forcing inheritance, implement bidirectional converters:\n- Keep both model systems intact\n- Create explicit converter layer between them\n- Test roundtrip conversions for data integrity\n- Single source of truth: attrs models for business logic\n\nKEY FIELD MAPPING CHALLENGES:\n1. SSHConfig: enable→enabled, users dict→list transformation\n2. StorageOption: Completely different structure (flat vs nested)\n3. ProxyConfig: Merged into NetworkConfig in WebGUI\n4. DeviceConfig: Merged into EnvironmentConfig in WebGUI\n5. CustomScriptConfig→ScriptsConfig: Different naming and structure\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:\n- Phase 1: Create converter infrastructure (Protocol pattern)\n- Phase 2: Implement specific converters for each model\n- Phase 3: Integrate with UIStateBridge\n- Phase 4: Comprehensive roundtrip testing\n- Phase 5: Feature flag for gradual migration\n\nBENEFITS:\n- No breaking changes to existing code\n- Type safety across conversion boundary\n- Can evolve UI models independently\n- Forced documentation of all mappings\n- ~800 lines added, but cleaner architecture",

Create Protocol interfaces defining expected behavior\n2. Build adapter classes wrapping attrs models for pydantic compatibility\n3. Map field differences in adapters (enable→enabled, dict→list transforms)\n4. Delegate validation to existing attrs validators\n5. Gradual migration maintaining backward compatibility\n\nBENEFITS:\n- Single source of truth for schema\n- Eliminate ~300 lines duplicate code\n- Consistent validation between CLI and GUI\n- Simplified maintenance (one place for changes)\n- Type safety preserved throughout",

Located in project directory. Master template: src/pei_docker/templates/config-template-full.yml\n\n2. **stage-1 and stage-2**: Two-stage architecture\n   - Stage-1: Initial stage building base image, installs system-level dependencies (apt), intended for many applications\n   - Stage-2: Second stage building docker image based on stage-1, installs application-level dependencies (pip, npm, ros2), specific to application\n\n3. **peidocker-data-model**: Data model representing user_config.yml during configuration, used by pei-docker-cli CLI and config_processor.py module\n\n4. **pei-docker-cli**: Command line interface for PeiDocker to create and manage projects. Source: src/pei_docker/pei.py\n\n**GUI-Specific Terminology:**\n\n1. **nicegui-web**: Web GUI implemented using NiceGUI framework. Source: src/pei_docker/webgui\n\n2. **ui-data-model**: Data model representing GUI state. Source: src/pei_docker/webgui/models/ui_state.py\n\n3. **ui-data-adapter**: Adapter converting between peidocker-data-model and ui-data-model. Source: src/pei_docker/webgui/models/config_adapter.py\n\nThis terminology is essential for maintaining consistency across the codebase, especially after the recent refactoring that implemented the adapter pattern to bridge attrs (CLI) and pydantic (GUI) models.",
