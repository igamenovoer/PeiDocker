        "PeiDocker Download Zip Function Fix (2025-08-06):\n\nPROBLEM: RuntimeError \"The current slot cannot be determined\" when clicking download button\n- Error occurred in src/pei_docker/webgui/app.py:537 in download_project() method\n- Tried to use ui.download() from within dynamically created FastAPI endpoint\n\nROOT CAUSE: \n- ui.download() must be called from NiceGUI UI context, not from FastAPI route handler\n- Creating dynamic endpoints with @app.get decorator doesn't work with ui.download()\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Use shutil.make_archive() to create zip file (recommended approach from docs)\n- Call ui.download() directly in the button event handler context\n- Use tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() for automatic cleanup\n\nCODE CHANGES in download_project():\n1. Added os import to imports section\n2. Replaced zipfile implementation with shutil.make_archive()\n3. Removed dynamic FastAPI endpoint creation\n4. Called ui.download() directly in UI context\n5. Used proper temporary directory management\n\nTESTING:\n- Created test script verifying zip creation logic works\n- Type checking passes with mypy\n- Handles Windows path correctly with os.path.join()\n\nKEY PATTERN: Always call ui.download() from UI context (button handlers), never from background tasks or API endpoints",

        "PeiDocker Download Fix - Temporary File Persistence Issue (2025-08-06):\n\nSECOND ISSUE: After first fix, got \"File at path does not exist\" error\n- Temp directory was cleaned up before browser could download the file\n- with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() deletes files immediately after context exits\n\nCOMPLETE SOLUTION in download_project():\n```python\n# Don't use context manager for temp directory\ntemp_dir = tempfile.gettempdir()\ntimestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')\ntemp_zip_base = os.path.join(temp_dir, f'{project_name}-{timestamp}')\n\n# Create zip file that persists\nzip_file_path = shutil.make_archive(temp_zip_base, 'zip', str(project_path))\n\n# Call ui.download in UI context\nui.download(zip_file_path, f'{project_name}.zip')\n```\n\nKEY LESSONS:\n1. ui.download() sets up async download - file must persist until browser requests it\n2. Don't use TemporaryDirectory context manager with ui.download()\n3. Add timestamp to filename to avoid conflicts\n4. Let OS handle temp file cleanup later\n\nTesting confirmed file persists and download works correctly.",
